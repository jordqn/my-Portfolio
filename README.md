# Welcome to My Portfolio

A showcase of my computer science projects, skills, and experience.

This portfolio highlights coursework, personal projects, and practical experience across computer systems, 
algorithms, networking, cyber security and artificial intelligence.
My intention is to give a transparent overview of my technical background as a Computer Science student. 

## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Queensland, majoring in Cyber Security and Machine Learning. 
I am currently seeking entry level roles, internships, or part-time opportunities while completing my studies.

## Projects

Some of the projects featured include:

- **Number Base Converter**  
  Command-line program that parses arithmetic expressions and converts results between number bases.

- **Custom Shell**  
  Unix-style shell supporting process execution, input/output redirection, and piping.

- **Networked Card Game**  
  Multiplayer card game using a client–server architecture over TCP sockets.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
  Implementations of core and advanced data structures and algorithms with a focus on time and space complexity.

- **Artificial Intelligence Projects**  
  - Heuristic search (A*, Uniform Cost Search)  
  - Markov Decision Processes (Value Iteration, Policy Iteration)  
  - Reinforcement Learning with tuned epsilon decay and learning rates

Each project is linked to its own repository with detailed documentation.
